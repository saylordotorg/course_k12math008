**Unit 1: Number Sense** <span id="1"></span> 
*Have you heard of the golden ratio, Euler’s number, or pi? All of these
are examples of irrational numbers. This unit will guide you through the
difference between rational and irrational numbers. While you learn
about how irrational numbers exist more often outside of a math book,
you will work to find a decimal approximation for these numbers. Whether
your interests are in music, math, art, finance, or history, you will
recognize that irrational numbers have an interesting place in your
mathematical understanding.*  
    
 *The unit will continue with radicals, integer exponents, and
scientific notation. Have you ever tried to express the population of
the whole world? What about a really small number like how many meters
the tectonic plates move in a year? In this unit, you will learn about
how to express these numbers without having to write out lots of place
values.*

**1.1 Rational and Irrational Numbers** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*Throughout your entire school career, you have worked with numbers.
Your earliest interaction with numbers was probably holding up a few
fingers to represent your current age. You continued to progress as you
learned to count, decipher odd and even numbers, and use the counting
numbers (whole numbers) to do math operations. When you reached about
sixth grade, you learned about integers (negative numbers) and
fractions/decimals (rational numbers). When you learned how to find the
area of a circle, you first encountered the number π, and how it relates
to the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. Pi is an
irrational number. In this subunit you will continue your learning about
what defines an irrational number, how these numbers are used, and how
they can be approximated.*

     Instructions: While you watch the video, take notes on the words or
    phrases written in bold. The tree diagram that is displayed and
    explained between the 1:00 and 3:00 marks is very important. Listen
    and watch as the instructor explains the diagram. Pause the video at
    the 3:00 mark and copy the diagram into your notebook. Take special
    interest of the term *irrational number*, as this is probably the
    most unfamiliar term to you.  
        
     Watch the video until the 3:40 mark. Pause the video when you see
    four problems displayed to compare. Use both an inequality symbol as
    shown in the previous slide and a number line to compare these
    values. Once you have solved them in your notebook, continue
    watching as the instructor solves and explains.  
        
     Watch the video until the 6:33 mark. Pause the video when you see
    the three true/false problems. Solve them in your notebook, and then
    continue watching as the instructor solves and explains.  
        
     The final topic, absolute value, is not relevant to this subunit.
    You can stop watching the video at the 7:30 mark.  
        
     Watching the video, taking notes, and working examples should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

**1.2 Exponents and Radicals** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*Exponents and radicals are used in math to represent both rational and
irrational numbers. The financial industry uses rational exponents to
compute interest rates. Radicals are often used in the real world where
geometry is involved, such as a carpenter trying to figure out square
footage. In this subunit, you will build on your prior knowledge of
exponents and integers to learn about integer exponents. You will also
focus on radicals, which is the mathematical term for square roots.*

**1.3 Scientific Notation** <span id="1.3"></span> 
*In life, we often encounter numbers that are very large (world
population) or very small (movement of plate tectonics in meters per
week). In this subunit you will learn how to use scientific notation to
express numbers. *

    Notation”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY-ecKyZ244) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch as the instructor introduces two examples of
    scientific notation. Pause the video at the 0:40 mark. Write down
    the definition and two examples in your notebook. As you write down
    the examples, think about how each number converts into scientific
    notation. On the next slide, you will notice that strategies learned
    with integer exponents will also be used in scientific notation.  
        
     Pause the video at the 2:10 mark. Write down the information at the
    top of the slide, and solve the two examples at the bottom of the
    slide. Continue watching to check your solution.  
        
     Pause the video at the 4:20 mark. Write down the information at the
    top of the slide, and solve the two examples at the bottom of the
    slide. Continue watching to check your solution.  
        
     Pause the video at the 6:02 mark. Think about how subunit 1.2.1,
    “Integer Exponents,” will relate to multiplying and dividing numbers
    in scientific notation. Complete the examples on the next slide.
    It’s OK to check your work on the calculator, as shown in the video;
    however, using the rules of scientific notation does not usually
    require a calculator.  
        
     Pause the video at the 8:10 mark and complete the example problems.
    Watch the remainder of the video and check your solutions.

**1.3.2 Operations with Scientific Notation** <span id="1.3.2"></span> 
-   **Explanation: CK-12: “Operations with Numbers in Scientific
    Notation”**
    Link: CK-12: [“Operations with Numbers in Scientific
    Notation”](http://www.ck12.org/algebra/Operations-with-Numbers-in-Scientific-Notation/lesson/Operations-with-Numbers-in-Scientific-Notation/) (HTML
    and YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This resource will help you understand how to
    complete operations while using scientific notation. One thing to
    recognize is that you don’t want to rely on needing to change a
    number into decimal notation to complete an operation. Use this
    resource to help you understand how numbers within scientific
    notation can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided.  
        
     Read the introduction and “Guidance” section. Take notes of the
    bold phrases and write down the example as you read. Read through
    the information about how to add and subtract. Notice the
    relationship between integer exponents and scientific notation when
    multiplying and dividing. Complete examples A, B, and C and
    understand their solutions.  
        
     Add the vocabulary words to your notes. Complete the “Guided
    Practice” and understand the solution. Watch the three videos. While
    you watch, solve the problems with the instructor.  
        
     Complete the “Practice” problems and check your solutions
    [here](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/K12MATH8-FLC-Unit-1-1-3-2Ck12_Operations-Scientific-Notation_answerkey-VFINAL.pdf).  
        
     Taking notes, solving practice problems, and watching the videos
    should take approximately 1 hour.
