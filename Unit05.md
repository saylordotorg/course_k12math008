**Unit 5: Statistics** <span id="5"></span> 
*Is there a relationship between the hours students spend studying for a
test and their test scores? We could use a scatter plot to graph this
situation: hours spent (x-axis) and test score (y-axis). The coordinates
on the graph would show if there is a relationship. In this unit, you
will learn about scatter plots as well as how to model situations with
bivariate data.* Bivariate data *is the term used in math to explain
that two variables (hours and test scores) are being used. *

**5.1 Graphing Bivariate Data** <span id="5.1"></span> 
*Have you ever wondered if having larger hands would improve your video
gaming skills? Or maybe you’ve speculated if your height has any
correlation with how high you can jump? A* correlation *is a
relationship between two variables. Mathematicians look for both a
positive and a negative correlation between variables. This subunit will
teach you about how to collect, organize, and graph data from two
variables (bivariate).*

    [“Scatterplots”](http://killianhma0910.wikispaces.com/8.+Scatterplots) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: In the first paragraph, read about scatterplots and
    what having a correlation means. You will see a list of seven
    general types of scatter plots ranging from “Perfect positive
    correlation” to “No evident correlation.” As an eighth-grade
    student, you will want to know about the types of correlation and
    how to graph correlations; however, you do not need to know about a
    correlation coefficient or the “R value” of a correlation. Skip the
    R Value (regression) paragraph. Read the remaining paragraphs on the
    page. Take notes on the examples of each type of correlation.
    Sketch/label each of the graphs. You will not need to know the
    information presented in the SAT Questions.  
        
     Reading this lesson and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

    Data”](http://www.ck12.org/statistics/Displaying-Bivariate-Data/lesson/Displaying-Bivariate-Data/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The purpose of this resource is to give you a general
    idea about what you will see and learn in this subunit. During this
    subunit, focus on learning what a scatter plot looks like, how it is
    created, and how a mathematician can read a scatter plot. You won’t
    spend a lot of time on making graphs or practicing skills in this
    resource.  
        
     Read the short paragraph under the “Guidance” section and take
    notes to help you understand what *bivariate* means. Look at the
    data in the table. Do you see how it is organized and easy to
    follow? The data is graphed in a scatter plot. Notice that the data
    points are *not* connected in a scatter plot. However,
    mathematicians do often draw a single line to represent the general
    trend of the data. You will work more with this line (called the
    *line of best fit*) in a future subunit. For now, read the paragraph
    under the scatter plot that has the line of best fit. Take notes on
    how mathematicians discuss bivariate data. Continue reading and
    taking notes until you reach the section titled “On the Web.” You
    will start practicing these skills in the next resource.  
        
     Reading this lesson and taking notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

    Data”](http://www.ck12.org/statistics/Scatter-Plots/lesson/Make-a-Scatterplot-to-Represent-Data/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read about Mr. Watson’s idea that there is a
    correlation between height and speed. What do you think? Would you
    expect taller athletes to be faster? Throughout this resource you
    are going to learn how to make a scatter plot. However, the creation
    of the scatterplot is not the only learning objective. You will want
    to make sure you understand how to organize your data in a table.
    Also, you want to start to make sense of the scatter plot to
    determine if there is a correlation between the variables.  
        
     Read the “Guidance” section and take notes on the bolded
    definitions in the text and in the “Vocabulary” section. Pay
    attention to how to recognize which variable is the input data that
    goes on the x-axis and which is the output data on the y-axis. Also,
    notice that when you make a scatter plot you can choose the range of
    the numbers on the axes based on the collected data. Make the
    scatter plot in your notebook that represents the data for studying
    math and the grade earned. Do you notice how all the data points
    trend upward to the right? That is called a *positive correlation*.
    Conversely, if the data points trended down to the right,
    mathematicians call this a *negative correlation*. You will work
    more with positive and negative correlations in future resources.  
        
     Read about the graphing calculator opportunity. Try it out on a
    graphing calculator if you have one. Complete examples A, B, and C
    and be sure you understand the solutions. Finally, you will complete
    the scatter plot that displays height and speed – do you see a
    correlation?  
        
     Reading this lesson, taking notes, and working through the examples
    should take approximately 30 minutes.

**5.1.2 Line of Best Fit** <span id="5.1.2"></span> 
*In the previous subunits, you made and interpreted scatter plots.
Often, mathematicians will use the trend of the scatter plot to draw a
line that represents the trend. As an eighth grader, you want to be able
to draw a line of best fit, use your prior knowledge of writing linear
equations to find an equation for the line of best fit that you drew,
and finally, use your line and equation to estimate additional data
points on the scatter plot.*

     Instructions: Begin reading the dialogue between the student and
    mentor. The third time the mentor speaks, click on “Regression” to
    access the hyperlink*.* In the box beneath the graph, enter: (1, 2)
    (2, 3) (3, 4). Then click on “update plot.” Select the button
    “Display line of best fit.” Notice how the line touches all the
    points in a straight line. Now, add (9, 3) to the list of
    coordinates. Notice how the line of best fit changes drastically; it
    also isn’t touching each coordinate anymore.  
        
     Finish reading the dialogue between the student and the mentor.
    Lastly, use the regression program to enter various coordinate
    points, create your own line of best fit, and then check it with the
    “Display line of best fit”button.

**5.2 Interpreting Bivariate Categorical Data** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Data collection, graphing, and looking for patterns do not always
happen just when you have a number as a variable, as with the time spent
studying versus test score situation. Sometimes people want to collect
and compare data that involve categorical variables such as eye color,
pets, sports, or school subjects. This subunit will focus on collecting
categorical data in two-way frequency tables and understanding relative
frequency in the data.*

    Data”**
    Link: Shodor’s *Interactivate*: [“Numerical and Categorical
    Data”](http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/discussions/NumericalCategoricalData/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the discussion between the students and mentor.
    This discussion should help you understand the difference between
    categorical and numerical data. The remainder of this unit will
    focus on categorical data. Make sure you are able to understand the
    difference between the two data types.  
        
     Reading the discussion should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: The two-way tables you learned about in the past few
    resources often use relative frequencies. In this resource, you will
    learn how to find a relative frequency from data in a frequency
    table.  
        
     Read through the data about how many hours students worked each
    day. Take notes on the bold-faced vocabulary words. Read and
    understand how to find a relative frequency. Notice that each of the
    relative frequencies uses the value 20 as the denominator and
    divisor because 20 students were surveyed.  
        
     You can stop at the “cumulative relative frequency” definition, as
    this does not pertain to the eighth-grade curriculum. You will have
    more opportunities to calculate relative frequency in the next
    resource.  
        
     Reading this lesson, taking notes, and studying the examples should
    take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: The two-way tables you have learned about in the past
    few resources often use relative frequencies. Read Rachel’s data
    that compares the number of text messages for adults and
    teenagers.  
        
     Relative frequency can be calculated for different parts of the
    data. For example, you could calculate the relative frequency of the
    *row data* or the relative frequency of the *column data.* Each of
    these separate strategies would change the total amount.  
        
     Calculate the relative frequency of the row data for text
    messaging. Read the paragraph that starts with “Part II,” which
    should contain information similar to the previous resource about
    relative frequency. Take any notes as you read. Scroll down to the
    top of the second page to check your work for the relative frequency
    of the row data.  
        
     Look at the table of relative frequency of column data on the
    bottom of the second page. Write two statements about this data.  
        
     Calculate the relative frequency of the whole table, using the idea
    that 48 people were surveyed. Check your work on the top of page
    3.  
        
     Completing this activity and checking your solutions should take
    approximately 30 minutes.
