Math is about patterns and this course is full of finding patterns,
interpreting patterns, and representing patterns. This course will build
on your prior knowledge of expressions and equations to display the
patterns in the form of graphs, equations, functions, tables, and
qualitatively with words. This course includes five units. Covered
topics include scientific notation, integer exponents, modeling
bivariate (two-variable) data with linear equations, functions, systems
of equations, the Pythagorean Theorem, and volume of spheres, cylinders,
and cones. While you are working through the five units, you will notice
that some of the material builds on your prior knowledge, and some of
the concepts will be new ideas that will serve as building blocks for
your future math career. In Unit 1, you will learn about irrational
numbers. You will use your prior knowledge of rational numbers to
represent an estimation of irrational numbers. You will learn that
scientific notation helps you denote really large and really small
numbers. In Unit 2, you will graph proportional relationships that will
build off your understanding of equations. You will be able to compare
different linear equations and in turn solve simultaneous linear
equations in a variety of forms. You will continue to work with patterns
in Unit 3 as you learn how a function has exactly one output for each
input. In both sixth and seventh grade, you learned about volume of
three-dimensional figures. Unit 4 offers you the opportunity to build on
that knowledge and solve real-world problems with volume of cones,
cylinders, and spheres. This geometry unit also introduces the
Pythagorean Theorem. This will give you a chance to solve for unknown
side lengths on right triangles. As you work through the Pythagorean
Theorem, make sure you understand why the rule works and that you can
apply it to other situations (don’t just memorize!). The final unit
involves graphing and again looking for patterns. The patterns in Unit 5
that you will be looking for will be patterns of association in
bivariate data. In other words, if you are given a collection of data,
your task will be to find a pattern (or lack thereof) between two
different variables. Throughout the entire course, understanding each
topic before moving forward is the goal. As you encounter the problems
involving real-life situations, strive to make sense of the circumstance
and how it would fit into your current life.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   Differentiate between rational and irrational numbers
-   Describe irrational numbers by approximating them with rational
    numbers.
-   Evaluate and extend your understanding of expressions involving
    radical and integer exponents.
-   Describe the connections among proportional relationships, lines,
    and linear equations.
-   Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear
    equations.
-   Define, evaluate, and compare functions and use functions to model
    relationships among quantities.
-   Interpret congruence and similarity of geometric figures.
-   Apply the Pythagorean Theorem and use models to describe how it
    works.
-   Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving volume of
    cylinders, cones, and spheres.
-   Investigate and analyze patterns of association in bivariate data.

### Course Requirements

### Course Information

Welcome to the Eighth Grade Math course. General information about this
course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer:** Kelly Quinn  
    
 **Primary Resources:**

-   Khan Academy
-   CK-12
-   Engage NY
-   HippoCampus
-   Howard County Public School System’s *Grade 8 Common Core
    Mathematics*
-   Illustrative Mathematics
-   Southern Nevada Regional Professional Development
-   James Sousa’s *Mathispower4u*

   
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
These assigned materials include readings, videos, exercises, tasks,
checkpoints, and a final exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the other assignments listed above.  
    
 In order to "pass" this course, you will need to earn a grade of 70% or
higher on the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as
soon as you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it
again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take a total of
approximately **72 hours**. Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. It
may be useful to take a look at these time advisories and determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and to
then set goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take
approximately 15 hours and 45 minutes. It may be helpful to sit down
with your calendar and decide, for example, to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 4 hours and 30 minutes) over the course of 5 nights, working
for about an hour each night.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** It would be helpful to have a notebook or binder
for all the materials you will complete in this course. As you read or
watch videos, take careful notes in your notebook. Mark down any
important ideas, formulas, and definitions that stand out to you. It
will be useful to use all of this work as a review prior to completing
the final exam.  
    
 While you are working through the course, focus on understanding what
you are doing. The early material creates the tools that you will use in
later sections, so make sure you do not skip over it. Solutions are
included in most exercises to check your work and to serve as a learning
tool. When you answer incorrectly or have trouble with a problem, you
can use the provided solutions to work backward to understand the
process. If you struggle with a topic even after exploring all the given
resources, searching the web for additional assistance or visiting some
of the above sites for supplemental explanations or practice would be
very useful.
