**Unit 3: Functions** <span id="3"></span> 
*Have you ever had to convert from a Celsius temperature to a Fahrenheit
temperature? If you know it is 25 degrees Celsius outside, there is a
function that you could use to figure out the Fahrenheit temperature. A
function is a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. So,
when you input 25°C, there is only one possible Fahrenheit temperature,
77°F, that reflects how warm it is outside. In this unit, you will work
with comparing functions, graphing functions, and using functions to
model relationships between quantities. Through the unit you will work
with linear and non-linear functions.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 11 hours and 45
minutes.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 3 hours and 45 minutes  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 2 hours and 15 minutes  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.3: 3 hours and 30 minutes  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.4: 2 hours and 15 minutes

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   Evaluate functions using the rule that each input has exactly one
    output.
-   Recognize that the graph of a function is the set of ordered pairs
    consisting of an input and output.
-   Compare properties of two functions represented in different ways.
-   Interpret and give examples of linear and non-linear equations.
-   Construct a function to model a linear relationship between two
    quantities.
-   Use tables or graphs to interpret rate of change of a linear
    function.
-   Sketch a graph that exhibits the features of a described function.
-   Describe what a graph looks like using qualitative features.

**3.1 What Is a Function?** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*A function is a relation between variables. Picture a candy factory
with all the machines inputting ingredients (sugar!) and outputting your
favorite sweet treat. If you input a different variety of ingredients,
then the output will be a different sweet treat. A function is the math
version of a candy factory. For every input there is only one output. If
you input a different value, it will lead to the output of a different
value. During this subunit you will be looking for patterns to help you
figure out the function, and you will begin to look at how functions
show up in both tables and graphs.*

**3.2 Proportional, Linear, and Non-Linear Functions** <span
id="3.2"></span> 
*There are different forms of functions. In this subunit, you will learn
about the difference between proportional, linear, and non-linear
functions and start to develop strategies you can use to recognize the
differences between these types of functions by just looking at a table,
at a graph, or at the equation. You will build on these ideas as you
continue in your math career. At this point, you will see that both
proportional and linear functions are the most familiar to you.*

     Instructions: Look at Function Family Sets 1, 2, and 3. Just by
    looking at the functions (don’t make a table or a graph yet),
    consider: does one of the equations look different than the others?
    Predict what you think each graph will look like. Using your
    graphing calculator, graph each equation in the specific set. Decide
    which equation does not “fit” with the rest of the Function
    Family.  
        
     Using the information from the previous videos, define each family
    as “linear,” “quadratic,” or “exponential.” Decide which family the
    outcast equation should be moved to from each specific set.

**3.3 Modeling Relationships with Functions** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*When a situation can be described with a function, people can make
predictions for scenarios. For example, once you know a relation between
speed and time, you can predict how much longer you will have to sit in
the car before arriving at your destination. Perhaps you are saving your
allowance for a new pair of jeans. You could use a function to model how
many weeks until you have saved the necessary amount of money.*

**3.4 Qualitatively Describing a Function** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*Graphs tell stories about what is happening in specific scenarios. When
you look at a graph, you should be able to get a snapshot of what is
happening even without looking at details such as numbers on the x-axis
and y-axis. For example, if you were looking at a time (x-axis) and
distance (y-axis) graph for a hike that you recently took, how would
your lunch stop show up on the graph? How would a steep uphill climb
show up on the graph? If you raced your younger sibling back to the car,
how would that rate of change show up on the graph? All these examples
are qualitative situations for describing a function. In this subunit,
you will write qualitative interpretations of graphs and sketch graphs
using qualitative descriptions.*

     Instructions: Read the introduction about rate of change and
    Example A. Make sure you understand the solution. Skip down to
    Example C. This shows a graph that tells a story of a delivery truck
    throughout one workday. Try to figure out what is happening at each
    of segments A-E before looking at the solutions. Use the labels of
    the x-axis and y-axis to make interpretations about the segments.
    Read and understand the solution for Example C. Skip to the
    “Practice” section. Answer the question that asks you to identify
    each section of the graph about Mark’s cycle ride.
