**4.1 Congruence and Similarity** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*Think about your best friend. Do you enjoy doing the same activities?
Maybe you like to listen to the same music, read the same type books, or
play the same games. Possibly you even wear the same style of clothing.
Most people hang out with others who are* similar *to them. The word*
similar *in math has a different meaning than the way people use it in
an everyday context. In this subunit, you will work with*
similar *shapes and* congruent *shapes. These will be important
vocabulary words to know and understand as you work your way through
this subunit.*

**4.2 Angle Relationships and Parallel Lines** <span id="4.2"></span> 
 *In seventh grade you learned relationships among angles. You probably
remember learning about complementary and supplementary angles. Angles
are essential in construction, specifically building strong bridges.
However, people use angles in their daily life as they maneuver into a
parking spot. Football kickers and soccer players also use angles when
they line up an important kick. This subunit will build on that
knowledge as you learn that angle relationships and parallel lines can
help mathematicians solve a variety of math problems. *

-   **Explanation: Khan Academy’s “Angles Formed between Transversals
    and Parallel Lines”**
    Link: Khan Academy’s [“Angles Formed between Transversals and
    Parallel
    Lines”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/parallel-and-perpendicular-lines/old_angles/v/angles-formed-between-transversals-and-parallel-lines) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Sketch the parallel lines and the transversal with
    the instructor. Label the angles as the instructor discusses them.
    Take notes on *corresponding angles*, *opposite angles*, and
    *supplementary angles*.  
        
     Watching the video and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

    2”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/parallel-and-perpendicular-lines/old_angles/v/angles-of-parallel-lines-2) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Sketch the parallel lines and the transversal with
    the instructor. Label the 60° angle. Pause the video at the 0:40
    mark. Figure out the missing angle measure. Go ahead and fill in all
    the missing angle measures. Continue watching the video as the
    instructor discusses how to find the angle measures.  
        
     Take note that there is a general mistake in the video. Notice that
    the 60° angles made by the parallel lines and transversal are
    actually obtuse angles (presumably 120°). This should be a trigger
    for you as a mathematician that the original label at the 0:40 is
    not accurate. Do not try to rely on estimation or measuring with a
    protractor if you are able to solve using supplementary angles.  
        
     As the second example starts, pause the video at the 3:45 mark and
    consider the question posed by the instructor. Look back to your
    notes about corresponding angles and opposite angles. Once you’ve
    made a determination on whether the lines are parallel or not, watch
    the remainder of the video.  
        
     Watching the video and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

     Instructions: The purpose of this resource is for you to practice
    labeling and figuring out missing angles. Start the video and watch
    as the instructor displays some lines and labels some angles. Pause
    the video at the 1:45 mark. Sketch the lines in your notebook. You
    don’t need to measure angles with a protractor, as the purpose is to
    figure out the missing angles just using the information given.  
        
     It you get stuck, watch the video for 45-second segments while the
    instructor gives you some answers about other missing angles. At the
    4:15 mark, the instructor begins talking about the sum of the angles
    in a triangle. This is important information that you will learn
    more about in the next subunit.  
        
     While watching the star example, pause the video at the 6:12 mark
    and see how many of the angles you can figure out, including the “?”
    angle. It you get stuck, watch the video for 45-second segments
    while the instructor gives you some answers about other missing
    angles. At the 7:30 mark, the instructor again talks about the sum
    of the angles in the triangle. Finally, finish the remainder of the
    video to understand how to find the missing angle.  
        
     Watching the video and taking notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: This video is an animation that shows you another way
    to see that the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to 180°.
    Watch the video and then cut out your own triangle. Fold in each
    corner and see if you can prove to yourself that the sum of the
    angles forms a straight line, which is 180°.  
        
     Another method of proving this would involve cutting out a
    triangle, tearing the three corners off the triangle, and then
    lining them up to form a straight angle. Try to do this on your
    own.

    Maps”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/K12MATH8-FLC-Unit4.3-TriangleAreaMaps.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: This activity is to help you understand the
    relationship between side lengths of a triangle. Take this resource
    as an opportunity to try to discover patterns before you are
    directly taught the information in future resources.  
        
     If you are able, it might be helpful to print the page so you can
    manipulate the triangles while you do this. A *conjecture* in math
    is a statement that is believed to be true based on initial
    understandings, but is not yet proved. Suppose you overheard another
    eighth-grade student make the conjecture about the second image that
    *when you have a right triangle, the area of the two smaller squares
    is equal to the area of the larger square.* Look at the triangle
    area maps. In the second image, focus on the size of the squares
    drawn off of each side length as you think about the conjecture.
    Answer the following questions as you use the triangle area maps to
    verify or disprove the conjecture.  
        
     1.    How might you find out if this conjecture is true?  
     2.    What information would you need to test your idea?  
     3.    How would you test it?  
     4.    If you are able to test the conjecture, is it true? If you
    can’t test it, explain why you’re unable to do so.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

    Theorem”](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/right_triangles_topic/pyth_theor/v/pythagorean-theorem) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: As you begin the video, the instructor introduces the
    Pythagorean Theorem. He makes it very clear which type of triangle
    the theorem applies to. As you watch and listen, take notes on the
    triangle type and the location of the hypotenuse. Follow along with
    the first example given to you. Notice how the instructor writes out
    each step to help organize his information. This will be helpful to
    you as you move into more challenging problems and you are solving
    for different side lengths. The answer to the first example could be
    shown as ≈ 11.40 if you wanted to solve for
    the![](file:///C:UsersUserAppDataLocalTempmsohtmlclip101clip_image001.wmz).
    Be aware that both answers are acceptable.  
        
     Follow along on the next two examples. The instructor uses the
    Pythagorean Theorem to solve for different side lengths then just
    the hypotenuse. Make sure you understand how the formula works for
    each example. You will have a lot more opportunity to practice this
    in future resources.  
        
     Watching the video and taking notes should take approximately 30

    Theorem”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwp0p-loCZg) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: In the first 2:45, the instructor shows a proof of
    why the Pythagorean Theorem works using similar triangles. There are
    quite a few other proofs available if you do a simple web search. It
    is important that you understand why the Pythagorean Theorem works
    as it will be beneficial to you to as you use it throughout math.
    Just after the 2:45 mark, the instructor works some example
    problems. Pause the video after he gives each example, and solve for
    the missing side length using the Pythagorean Theorem. Watch as the
    instructor shows/explains the answer.

     Instructions: Take notes on how the Pythagorean Theorem applies to
    a right triangle, acute triangle, and obtuse triangle. The converse
    of the Pythagorean Theorem is stated between 0:35–0:45. The
    instructor does not make it explicitly clear this is what he is
    stating. You will have a chance to work with the converse of the
    Pythagorean Theorem in the next resource. Make sure to take note
    about the term *triangle inequality*. When the instructor presents
    an example, pause the video to solve the problem and then continue
    watching the video while checking your solution.

     Instructions: Watch the video completely without pausing. Once the
    video is over, consider who ran farther: New England Patriot player
    (white jersey) Benjamin Watson or Denver Bronco player (navy blue
    jersey) Champ Bailey? Watch the video again, this time pausing at
    the 1:59 mark to look at where each player starts the play.
    Consider: How could you use triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem to
    figure out each of their distances? Don’t solve; just think about
    it. Continue watching, and listen as Tedy Brushi says, “He ran like
    120 yards to get there.” Is Tedy correct? In the next resource you
    will explore this real-world football play in more detail.

     Instructions: Read about the situation involving the football
    players from the video in the previous resource. Answer questions
    a–c. Note that there are hash marks on both the length and the width
    of the football field diagram to help with your estimation. If you
    are struggling with solving any part of the problems, it might be
    helpful to read the commentary on the top of page 2. Once you are
    ready, check your solutions with the answer on pages 2–3. Think back
    to the video and the Tedy Brushi comment that “he ran like 120 yards
    to get there.” Is Tedy accurate? How could you explain to Tedy a
    more exact number of yards that Ben Watson ran?

    Cone”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y0ZMnCcVGs) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: The first 0:45 of the video explain the relationship
    between a cone and a cylinder with equal radius and height.
    Understanding the relationship is helpful to understanding and
    remembering the formulas. Copy down in your notebook the formulas
    for the volume of a cylinder and the volume of a cone. Work the
    example with the instructor. The instructor goes through two ways to
    solve for the volume of the cone. Make sure you understand both
    strategies and the appropriate units used for volume.  
        
     Watching the video and completing the examples should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Look at each of the glasses on page 1. Notice how
    glass 1 is a cylinder and glass 3 is a cone. However, glass 2 is
    composed of both a hemisphere and a cylinder. In sixth grade you
    worked with two-dimensional composite shapes. In this activity you
    will need to work with a shape composed of different
    three-dimensional shapes. Complete questions a–c on page 1. It will
    probably be helpful to sketch the shape in your notebook, label the
    given side lengths, and solve each step with precision. Read the
    commentary on the top of page 2. Consider the bullet points that are
    included “to foster a number of discussions.” If you were in a
    classroom setting, how could you contribute to each question? Check
    your answers on pages 2–4. Read each of the explanations carefully
    and compare the student drawings to the drawings in your notebook.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.
