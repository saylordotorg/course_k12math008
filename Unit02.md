**Unit 2: Expressions and Equations** <span id="2"></span> 
*Suppose your parents recently told you they would help you purchase
your first cell phone. Your job is to figure out which company to use.
Call for Less Phone Company offers a low cost up front, but they charge
you per text message. Text for Less Phone Company is costly to enroll,
but they offer free text messaging. Which company is better for you? You
might compare two different cell phone companies using a system of
equations. In this unit, you will learn about proportional
relationships. You can express proportional relationships in tables,
graphs, and equations. Throughout the unit, you will focus on finding
slope, finding y-intercept, finding patterns, and comparing graphs to
equations. *

**2.1 Proportional Relationships** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*A proportional relationship is when two quantities vary directly with
each other. This means that when one quantity is doubled, the other
quantity is doubled. Proportional relationships can be written as
equations, tables, or graphs. In this subunit you will use proportional
relationships to compare different situations, and you will graph
proportional relationships and interpret the unit rates.*

**2.2 Using Triangles on the Coordinate Plane** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*You learned in the previous subunit how to find slope using any two
points on a line. In this subunit you will use similar right triangles
to explain why slope is the same between any two points on a
non-vertical line in the coordinate plane.* Similar triangles *have the
same shape, but can be different sizes. Triangles can be similar even if
one is rotated or one is a mirror image of the other. Similar triangles
will have the same angles, and their side lengths will be proportional.*
Congruent *means the same shape and same size, so congruent triangles
will have the same angles and same side lengths. You may encounter these
vocabulary words throughout this subunit.*

    complete questions 1-7. On page 7, complete questions 1-3.  
        
     Challenge (optional) – complete the slide and ski slope activity on
    page 5. The activity gives you a lot of numbers. Sketch a picture
    and label the information. Answer the questions on page 5 as well.

     Instructions: Watch the video and take notes. Make sure you
    understand what terms can be combined. Pause the video at the 1:25
    mark to take notes on the slide about similar terms. The next slide
    introduces the *distributive law*, which is also called the
    distributive property. Take notes on how you can change the way
    expressions are written by rearranging the values in specific ways.
    Listen closely at the 2:35 mark. The instructor mentions the
    *commutative property* as a reason for why *a* can be placed either
    before or after the set of parenthesis. This is another good
    vocabulary word to know. Watch and practice the examples with the
    instructor.

**2.4 Simultaneous Linear Equations** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*Often when working with linear equations, you are comparing two or more
situations. Perhaps, for example, you are trying to figure out which
cell phone plan is the cheapest for you based on the data plan you want.
In this subunit, you will learn how to solve simultaneous linear
equations using the coordinate plane and substitution with the
equations. You will also have the opportunity to work with real-life
situations. It is important that you know how to solve simultaneous
linear equations a few different ways because some situations lend
themselves to graphing, and some situations are more efficient when you
use the substitution method.*

    Equations.” While you watch the video, take notes and write down
    examples. Pay attention to what it means when lines intersect.
    Understand the difference between linear equations that have one
    solution, infinite solutions, and no solutions. The instructor
    explains what a *system of equations* is when the timer reads 1:00.
    Make sure to take notes on this concept. Stop the video while you
    watch if you need extra time to take notes.  
        
     Watching the video and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.
